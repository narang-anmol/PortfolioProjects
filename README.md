# Anmol Narang's Portfolio

Greetings and thank you for visiting my SQL portfolio! Within this repository, you'll find examples of SQL queries that I've developed both independently and as part of my journey through SQL and other data analytics courses. The projects showcased here span various domains and showcase my proficiency in extracting insights from relational databases.

Here are some of the highlighted projects, which demonstrate my skills in data profiling, analysis, data cleaning and reporting:

[Flight Data Exploration (SQL)](https://github.com/narang-anmol/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Flight%20Data%20Exploration.sql) -
    In this project, I delved into an airline-related database to perform data profiling and analysis. I explored various aspects such as flight routes, durations, booking patterns, ticket prices, airport insights, aircraft analysis, and customer behavior. The queries provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset, revealing trends and patterns within the aviation domain.
