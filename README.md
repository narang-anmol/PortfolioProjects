# Anmol Narang's Portfolio

Greetings and thank you for visiting my portfolio! Within this repository, you'll find examples of SQL queries that I've developed both independently and as part of my journey through SQL and other data analytics courses. I've used PostGreSQL with PGadmin4 to write and execute these queries. The projects showcased here span various domains and showcase my proficiency in extracting insights from relational databases.

Here are some of the highlighted projects, which demonstrate my skills in data profiling, analysis, data cleaning and reporting:

[Flight Data Exploration (SQL)](https://github.com/narang-anmol/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Flight%20Data%20Exploration.sql) -
    In this project, I delved into an airline-related database to perform data profiling and analysis. I explored various aspects such as flight routes, durations, booking patterns, ticket prices, airport insights, aircraft analysis, and customer behavior. The queries provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset, revealing trends and patterns within the aviation domain.

[Flight Data Visualization (Tableau)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anmol.narang/viz/Book1_17043224770080/Dashboard1?publish=yes) - I've turned airline data into engaging visuals. Explore traveler preferences in fare categories and sought-after seat spots. Track daily booking trends with a visual breakdown. The interactive map illustrates airport traffic, each marker reflecting total departures and arrivals. Enjoy the visual journey into the world of aviation!

[Housing Data Cleaning (SQL)](https://github.com/narang-anmol/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Housing%20Data%20Cleaning.sql) - In this data cleaning project, I focused on enhancing the quality and consistency of the Nashville Housing dataset using SQL queries. These SQL transformations aim to create a cleaner and more structured dataset, laying the groundwork for more insightful analysis and reporting in future data-driven endeavors.

[Coffee Orders Data Analysis and Visualization (MS Excel)](https://github.com/narang-anmol/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/coffeeOrdersData.xlsx) - In this Excel portfolio project, I used dynamic pivot tables with filters to streamline and analyze coffee orders and customer data. By leveraging Excel's advanced features, I created a dynamic system that allows for seamless exploration and visualization of coffee-related transactions. This project not only enhances data organization and accessibility but also provides a user-friendly interface for a more insightful understanding of coffee orders and customer dynamics.

[Three Statement Finance Model (MS Excel)](https://github.com/narang-anmol/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Three%20Statement%20Model.xlsx) - This financial model provides a thorough examination of Lippman's Bakery's Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement. The Income Statement describes the bakery's income, costs, and profitability; the Balance Sheet shows its assets, liabilities, and equity; and the Cash Flow Statement analyzes cash inflows and outflows, emphasizing liquidity and operational sustainability.
